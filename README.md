# FlexPay
## This is like "Apple Pay for crypto" but WAY more powerful

### User selects asset to pay with (NFT, SOL, random token)
Real-time pricing via APIs (OpenSea, Jupiter, CoinGecko)
Calculate required amount + slippage
Execute swap/sale on DEX/marketplace
Convert to USDC
Send USDC to merchant
Transaction complete

### Potential Challenges
1. Liquidity issues: Some assets might not be liquid enough
2. Slippage on large purchases: Expensive items might move markets
3. Gas fees: Ethereum transactions could be expensive
4. User education: People need to understand the flow
5. Tax implications: Users need to track capital gains
